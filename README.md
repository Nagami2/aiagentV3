# aiagentV3

A small demo that uses the Google GenAI Python SDK to create a chat completion. The project shows how to load environment variables (for the API key), call the GenAI client, and print a generated response.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or newer
- A Google API key for the Google GenAI service or Vertex AI access
- (Optional but recommended) a virtual environment tool such as `venv` or `pipx`

## Setup

1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install runtime dependencies. This project currently expects the following packages (install them into your venv):

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install google-genai python-dotenv
```

3. (Optional) Add the dependency to `pyproject.toml`'s `dependencies` list or manage your own lockfile.

## Environment variables

Create a `.env` file at the project root with the following content:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

The code in `main.py` uses `python-dotenv` to load the `.env` file and sets `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]` from it. Alternatively, you can export the environment variable in your shell:

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_api_key_here"
```

If you prefer Vertex AI (service account) credentials, set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the JSON key path and update `main.py` to use `genai.Client(vertexai=True, project="MY_PROJECT", location="MY_LOCATION")`.

## Run the demo

With the virtual environment activated and `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set, run:

```bash
python main.py
```

You should see a printed haiku generated by the GenAI client.

## Troubleshooting

- If `from dotenv import load_dotenv` raises ImportError, ensure `python-dotenv` is installed in the active interpreter (`pip show python-dotenv`).
- If the GenAI client raises a missing key or credential error, verify `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set and valid, or switch to Vertex AI credentials as described above.
- If you see OpenSSL/LibreSSL warnings, they are usually informational and do not block functionality.

## Notes

- Keep secrets out of version control. Add `.env` to `.gitignore` if you add one.
- Consider pinning dependencies in `pyproject.toml` or a lockfile for reproducible environments.
